## Art Style Guidelines

RimWorld storyteller portraits follow a consistent aesthetic:
- **Painterly/illustrated style** (not photorealistic)
- **Dark, moody lighting** with dramatic shadows
- **Portrait framing** - head and upper shoulders
- **Neutral to serious expression**
- **Background**: Dark gradient or atmospheric effects

## Character Concept: "The Narrator"

An AI author who weaves stories - suggested visual elements:

- **Appearance**: Mysterious, androgynous figure with an otherworldly quality
- **Key motifs**: 
  - Glowing eyes (suggest AI/omniscience)
  - Quill pen, book, or scrolling text effects
  - Digital/holographic elements blended with classic storyteller imagery
  - Ethereal hood or cloak
- **Color palette**: Deep purples, blues, and gold accents
- **Mood**: Wise, contemplative, slightly ominous

## AI Art Prompt (for Midjourney/DALL-E/Stable Diffusion)

```
Portrait of a mysterious narrator storyteller, hooded figure with 
softly glowing cyan eyes, ethereal and androgynous, holding an 
ancient book with luminous pages, digital particles and text 
floating around them, dark atmospheric background with subtle 
purple and blue gradients, painterly illustration style matching 
RimWorld game aesthetics, dramatic lighting, fantasy meets sci-fi, 
portrait orientation, moody and contemplative expression
```

## Technical Requirements

- **Format**: PNG with transparency support
- **Color depth**: 32-bit RGBA
- **No compression artifacts** - save at maximum quality
- The large portrait may have subtle transparency at edges

## Reference

Look at existing RimWorld storyteller portraits for style reference:
- Cassandra Classic: Professional, stern
- Phoebe Chillax: Relaxed, friendly  
- Randy Random: Chaotic, mischievous

The Narrator should feel **wise and omniscient** - like someone who has read every story ever written.
